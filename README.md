## 缘起-论文
### 1.1 课题研究背景及意义
非处方药（OTC）就是不需要医生开方即可购买和使用的药物，大都用于多发病常见病的自行诊治，如感冒、咳嗽、头痛、发热、消化不良等，相对处方药而言，其安全性要高一些[1]。
在选用非处方药品时应该注意在正规渠道购买合格药品、不可盲目用药且应该仔细阅读药品说明书[2]。由于生活方式、气温等原因，人们在日常生活中会时不时地遇到一些常见的疾病如感冒、发烧、擦伤，这时部分患者会考虑去药店寻医购药，而每个患者的抵抗力和病情的不同，通常会在药品使用完毕前恢复，这就产生了闲置药品。另外，由于从药店购买回来的药品通常价格不便宜，这就导致两种后果：一、花大价钱购买的药品仅仅用了其中一小部分从而产生药品的浪费，二、患者购药的大半花费被浪费掉了。
李道梅[3]等人推荐居家常备一些非处方药如退烧止疼药布洛芬但同时也指出在备太多药的情况下，很可能出现药品过期的现象。虽然社会各方已经意识到药品回收的重要性，但目前的回收活动大多具有不确定性，缺乏规范有效的实施方案[4]，本文将目光转向社会的缩影-高等院校，来研究闲置药品在高校学生手中的流动，以期在一定程度上减少高校学生群体中闲置药品的浪费。
### 1.2 相关课题实践研究现状
近年来已经出现多种类型的就近购药送药服务如阿里大药房、叮当快药以及居民区内的药品自动贩卖机[5]，这种类似的服务可以使得患者在患病时进行使用，如叮当快药时一家互联网“医疗+医药”健康到家服务平台，该平台提供的服务有用药指导、核心区域7×24小时服务,服务范围内28分钟免费送到家[6]，这种网上购药专人送单的服务为患者提供的药品为全新包装的。诸如叮当快药等送药购药服务并未直接解决患者手中的闲置药品，甚至会增加痊愈患者手中闲置药品总数。
高校学生宿舍属于人口居住密集型生活环境，对于常见的疾病如感冒、擦伤
等最快的治疗方式不是去药店购买，而是就近询问其他同学是否具有对应药品。当前我国法律并无明文指出闲置药品的处理流程，且由于药品的特殊性，一旦闲置药品的转让合法化将会给违法分子提供可利用的机会[7]。而目前关于如何处理居民手中的闲置药品，国内外并无确切一致的处理意见，通常可以将闲置药品随生活垃圾一同处理[8][9]。高校学生以学业为主，若通过倒卖药品盈利会影响其在校声誉，而通过分享闲置药品会增进同学之间的友谊，故在高校学生群体中进行药品分享是可行的。

## Origin-thesis
### 1.1 Background and significance of the study
Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are drugs that can be purchased and used without a doctor's prescription, and are mostly used for self-medication of common diseases, such as colds, coughs, headaches, fevers, and indigestion, and are safer than prescription drugs [1].
When choosing over-the-counter drugs, one should pay attention to buying qualified drugs from regular channels, not to use them blindly and should read the drug instructions carefully [2]. Due to lifestyle, temperature and other reasons, people may encounter some common diseases such as cold, fever and scrapes in their daily life from time to time, and then some patients will consider going to pharmacies to buy medicines, while the resistance and condition of each patient is different, and they usually recover before the medicines are used up, which creates unused medicines. In addition, because the drugs purchased from pharmacies are usually not cheap, this leads to two consequences: first, the drugs purchased at a large price are only used a small part of them thus resulting in the waste of drugs, and second, most of the cost of the drugs purchased by patients is wasted.
Li Daomei [3] and others recommend keeping over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen, a fever and pain reliever, at home, but also point out that when too many medications are kept, there is a high risk of expiration of the medications. Although all parties in society have realized the importance of drug recycling, most of the current recycling activities are uncertain and lack of standardized and effective implementation plans [4], this paper turns its attention to the microcosm of society - higher education institutions to study the flow of unused drugs in the hands of college students, with a view to reducing the waste of unused drugs in the college student population to some extent.
### 1.2 Current status of practical research on related topics
In recent years, there have been various types of medicine delivery services in the vicinity such as Ali Pharmacy, Dingdong Express and medicine vending machines in residential areas [5], which can be used by patients when they are sick. The services provided by this platform include medication guidance, 7×24 service in the core area, and free home delivery within 28 minutes of service [6], and this kind of online medication delivery service provides patients with newly packaged medications. Delivery and purchase services such as Dingdong Express do not directly solve the problem of unused drugs in the hands of patients, and even increase the total number of unused drugs in the hands of recovered patients.
Student dormitories in universities are densely populated living environments, and the fastest way to treat common illnesses such as colds and scrapes is not to go to a pharmacy.
The fastest way to treat common illnesses such as colds and scrapes is not to go to a pharmacy, but to ask other students nearby if they have the corresponding medicine. At present, the law in China does not explicitly state the process of handling unused drugs, and because of the special nature of drugs, once the transfer of unused drugs is legalized, it will provide opportunities for lawbreakers to take advantage of [7]. At present, there is no definite and consistent opinion at home and abroad on how to dispose of unused drugs in the hands of residents, which can usually be disposed of along with household garbage [8][9]. Students in colleges and universities focus on their studies, and if they sell drugs for profit, it will affect their reputation in school, while sharing unused drugs will enhance the friendship among students, so it is feasible to share drugs among students in college groups.
